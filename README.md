4.Use the Java classes BinarySearchTree, AVLTree, RedBlackBST, SplayTree given in class. For each tree:
a. Insert 100,000 integer keys, from 1 to 100,000 (in that order). Find the average time for each insertion.
b. Do 100,000 searches of random integer keys between 1 and 100,000. Find the average time of each search.
c. Delete all the keys in the trees, starting from 100,000 down to 1 (in that order). Find the average time of each deletion.
5. For each tree:
a. Insert 100,000 keys between 1 and 100,000. Find the average time of each search.
b. Repeat #4.b.
c. Repeat #4.c but with random keys between 1 and 100,000. Note that not all the keys may be found in the tree.
